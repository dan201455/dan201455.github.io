Hi welcome. 

I am Dan. Online I am mostly known as D.
I make simple code for my friends and this is one of them. It is for discord that makes the name changes colour and some also nice stuff for their discord. I am not the creator of any of this. What I do is take snipits of other peoples "free to use" work and change it so that it does what I need it to.

the version name of the file goes like this.

The first number is the 10s row. The 2nd number is the units row.(how many people there are on the file) And the last number is the hot fix. For example:
1.8.6
There are 18 people on this file and it is at hot fix 6 of that version. 

Each time the version goes up a person the hot fixes will reset to 0

Thanks for stopping to look at my pathtic work.

D.
